# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Design

Minimal and typographic: a single 672px column, monochrome plus one accent, Geist Sans for prose and Geist Mono for dates, tech lists, and section labels. No shadows, gradients, images, or animation beyond color transitions.

- Every clickable element gets hover, `focus-visible`, and active states.
- Only animate `transform` and `opacity`. Never `transition-all`.
- Use the spacing scale consistently rather than arbitrary steps.
- The accent is never default Tailwind blue or indigo.

## Writing

Comments are bare or absent — never advice addressed to the reader. The same goes for placeholder strings and commit messages. Plain words over jargon.
